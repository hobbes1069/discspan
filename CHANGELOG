DiscSpan Changelog:

TODO:

Support for following symlinks
WARNING - If your stuff has symlinks, they will NOT be copied.

Strip out the depedencie on HAL for getting disc / drive info,
and put in something that's not on the list to be deprecated.

Work with python burn developer to get disc spanning feature into
their product. http://pypi.python.org/pypi/burn/0.4.6

Win the lottery; build a hotel on the Moon; and retire.

*** 0.2.2 - 2010.08.09 ***

Fixed: Option "--test" option was broken in 0.2.1.

Fixed: Don't eject tray when --test or --iso-dir options are used.

Fixed: Cleaned up drive/media detection code a little and added more meaninful output. NOTE: On my system HAL does not get updated properly and causes issues detecting media. 

Added: Option "--skip-big" was added to optionally skip files that were too big for ISO 9660 or recording media (CDs) instead of exiting.

Added: Logic to try to predict ISO file system size to reduce need for --size-factor option.


*** 0.2.1 - 2010.07.29 ***

* "--size-factor" option was added for modifying the capacity of the disk on the fly. 
* "--verbose" option will spit out the file names which is now normally suppresed. 
* "--iso-dir" option was added to write to ISO files instead of directly to the burner
* Some more diagnostic output was added, such as how many files will be on each disc and the approximate size of the finished disc. 


*** 0.2.0 - 2010.06.08 ***

Mostly re-written with less suck.  Tried an object-oriented approach.

Should work on modern systems, tested on Fedora 12.

Requires a discspan.ini file, speed _must_ be set in this file. 

Have added a --help option, and using real option parsing now.

We are using isolevel 4 for burns, as to not run in to 
directory depth problems that exist with isolevel 3.

Default config files can be /etc/discspan.ini or /usr/local/etc/discspan.ini.
Otherwise it must be specified with the below option.

New options:

Usage: discspan.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --start-disc=START_DISC
                        Specify disc to start with (in case of failed previous
                        burn)
  --config=CONFIG_FILE  Location of config file.
  --test                Performs a test run of the burn.
  --dir=BACKUP_DIR      Directory to backup.
  --volume-name=VOLUME_NAME
                        Name for the volume.

If you leave out --dir, you will be prompted for it.  The volume name
will default to "spandisc" if it is not specified.
